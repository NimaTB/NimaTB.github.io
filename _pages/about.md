<h2>Welcome</h2>

I'm Nima Taghipour Bazargani, a dedicated electrical engineer with expertise in power systems, machine learning, and data science. I specialize in solving real-world challenges in energy infrastructure, from event detection using synchrophasor data to optimizing electricity market simulations. I am currently seeking new opportunities in power systems engineering, data analysis, or related fields following the end of my most recent role.

Most recently, as a **Power System Engineer** at [Electric Power Group (EPG)](https://www.electricpowergroup.com/), I focused on the Inertia Forecast project, developing a Python-based solution for forecasting system strength and inertia in power grids. By leveraging real-time PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) data, I implemented incremental (continual) learning—specifically, a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approach—to adapt forecasting models on an hourly basis, capturing short-term fluctuations and long-term trends while retaining historical knowledge and minimizing catastrophic forgetting.


Previously, as a **Network Model Analyst** at [CWP Energy](https://www.cwpenergy.com/), I performed large-scale security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and economic dispatch simulations for key U.S. markets (MISO, SPP, PJM, ERCOT). I also optimized a PYTHON-based simulation pipeline integrated with Google Cloud, enabling efficient long-term forecasting and analysis.

<p>Previously, I served as a Network Model Analyst at <a href="https://www.cwpenergy.com/">CWP Energy</a>, where I conducted large-scale security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and economic dispatch simulations for major electricity markets in the U.S., including MISO, SPP, PJM, and ERCOT. Additionally, I enhanced the PYTHON simulation pipeline and its interaction with Google Cloud databases to enable large-scale, long-term simulations.</p>

<h2>Professional Expertise</h2>

<p>With over 10 years of experience in both research and industry, I am deeply engaged in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Applying machine learning (ML) and data science to enhance power system monitoring, stability, and reliability.</li>
    <li>Planning and operating power systems with a focus on resiliency, ensuring reliable power delivery in the face of disruptions and extreme events.</li>
    <li>Exploring electricity markets, focusing on quantitative trading strategies, long-term financial transmission rights auctions, and financial hedging against price risks from transmission congestion.</li>
</ul>

<p>These areas reflect both my experience and the subjects I’m eager to continue exploring as the power systems and energy sectors evolve.</p>

<h2>Academic Journey</h2>

<p>I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU), specializing in the real-time identification of power system events using high-dimensional spatio-temporal PMU data, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/">Professor Oliver Kosut</a> and <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/">Professor Lalitha Sankar</a>. My research was supported by the National Science Foundation. <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/high-dimensional-spatio-temporal-data-science-for-a-resilient-power-grid-towards-real-time-integration-of-synchrophasor-data/">Learn more about my research here</a>.</p>

<h2>Research Projects</h2>

<p>Throughout my Ph.D., I actively contributed to several significant research projects, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>National Science Foundation grants <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934766&HistoricalAwards=false">OAC-1934766</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2048223&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2048223</a>, and <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2029044&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2029044</a>.</li>
    <li>Power System Engineering Research Center (PSERC) Project S-87. <a href="https://documents.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/publications/reports/2021_reports/S_87_Final_Report.pdf">See the final report here</a>.</li>
    <li>The U.S.-Israel Energy Center, managed by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation. More details can be found <a href="https://us-isr-energycenter.org/energy_cyber/USIE.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These projects honed my expertise in integrating statistical theories, machine learning, and data science to solve power system challenges, particularly those involving time series classification and forecasting.</p>

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>

<p>Outside of my professional work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me inspired:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reading, especially in areas like history, psychology, neuroscience, social science, and philosophy.</li>
    <li>Outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and off-roading.</li>
    <li>Solving puzzles, including challenging metal brain teasers and 3d wire puzzles.</li>
</ul>
