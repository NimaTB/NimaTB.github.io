<<<<<<< HEAD
The growing number of weather-related outages in power systems highlights the role of resilience of electrical grid infrastructures. Quantifying the resiliency metric is necessary in a power system to evaluate the possible consequences of High Impact-Low Probability (HILP) events. This paper proposed a novel method to calculate a probabilistic time-dependent expected resilience metric which is obtained from combined discrete and continuous probability distribution functions. Considering uncertainties related to the load consumption and intermittent generation of Photovoltaic (PV) systems as input variables, Point Estimate Method (PEM) is applied in order to handle stochastic inherent of them and the fulfillment of the proposed probabilistic method is compared with Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) technique. This paper analyzes the impacts of hurricane events in a Conventional Distribution System (CDS) and compares it with an Active Distribution System (ADS) using an expected resilience metric. Graph theory concept is used to evaluate restoration feasibility of costumers. The proposed Probabilistic Hurricane Resiliency Assessment (PHRA) is tested on the IEEE 37-node.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
